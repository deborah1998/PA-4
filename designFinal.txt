My Question:How many people are on this ship were above the age of 50 who survived?


Function Name:read_in_file
Purpose:read in a file from the user and return it once they give one that exists
Parameters:None
Return:filename
Algorithm:

1.)Ask the user to input a file
2.)while the file does not exist:
    a.)ask the user to input a file
3.)return filename

Function Name:process_file
Purpose:process the file
Parameters:infilename
Return:None

1.)Open the input file from the user.
2.)set a variable representing the number of survivors equal to zero
3.)set a variable representing the number of people in class one equal to 0
4.)set a variable representing the number of people in class two equal to zero
5.)set a variable representing the number of people in class three equal to zero
6.) set a variable representing the nunmber of people on the titanic above the age of fifty to 0
7.)For every line in input file:
    a.class|survived|name|sex|age|embark|destination = line.split("|")
    b.if survived is 1:
        i) add one to the number of survivors
         c.if  class is 1:
            i) add one to the  number of people in class one
            ii)divide the sum of the number of people  who survived in class one by the total number of survivors and multiply by 100

         d. otherwise if class is 2:
            i)add one to the number of people in class two
            ii)divide sum of the number of people to survive in class two by the total  number of surviviors and multiply  by 100

         e.otherwise if class is 3:
            i)add one to the number of people in class two
            ii)divide sum of the number of people to survive in class two by the total  number of surviviors and multiply  by 100

            *question of my choosing

         f.if age is > 50:
            i)add one to the number of people on the titanic above the age of fifty
            ii)divide sum of the number of people to survive who are above the age of 50  by the total  number of surviviors and multiply  by 100
8.)close the input file





Function Name:main
Purpose:main
Parameters:none
