My Question:How many people are on this ship were above the age of 50 who survived?


Function Name:read_in_file
Purpose:read in a file from the user and return it once they give one that exists
Parameters:None
Return:filename
Algorithm:

1.)Ask the user to input a file
2.)while the file does not exist:
    a.)ask the user to input a file
3.)return filename

Function Name:process_file
Purpose:process the file
Parameters:filename,outfile_name
Return:None


1.)try
1.)Open the input file from the user.
2.)Open the output file that the user names.
2.)set a variable representing the number of survivors equal to zero
3.)set a variable representing the number of people in class one equal to 0
4.)set a variable representing the number of people in class two equal to zero
5.)set a variable representing the number of people in class three equal to zero
6.)set a variable representing the nunmber of people on the titanic above the age of fifty to 0
7.)set a variable representing the number of survivors in class one  equal to zero
8.)set a variable representing the number of survivors in class two equal to zero
9.)set a variable representing the number of survivors in class three equal to zero
10.)set a variable representing the number ofsurvivors above the age of 50 equal to zero
11.) try for every line in input file:
    a.class|survived|name|sex|age|embark|destination = line.split("|")
    b.if survived is 1:
        i) add one to the number of survivors
        ii)print the  name and destination of surviviors and store it in the output file that the user names
         c.if  class is 1:
            i) add one to the  number of people in class one
                d.if survived is 1:
                        i)add one to the number of survivors in class one

         e. otherwise if class is 2:
            i)add one to the number of people in class two
                f.if survived is 1:
                        i)add one to the number of survivors in class two

         g.otherwise if class is 3:
            i)add one to the number of people in class two
            h.if survived is 1:
                        i)add one to the number of survivors in class three

            *question of my choosing

         i.if age is > 50:
            i)add one to the number of people on the titanic above the age of fifty
            j.if survived is 1:
                        i)add one to the number of survivors above the age of 50


    12.)set a variable for the percantage of people to survive in class one equal to survivors in class1  divide by people in class1  then multiply by100
    13.)set a variable for the percantage of people to survive in class two  equal to survivors in class2  divide by people in class2  then multiply by100
    14.)set a variable for the percantage of people to survive in class three  equal to survivors in class3  divide by people in class3  then multiply by100
    15.)set a variable for the percantage of people to survive above the age of 50 equal to survivors over 50  divide by people over the age of 50  then multiply by100
    16.)output "The number of survivors is",num_of_survivors,"The percent of survivors in class 1 is", survivors_1,"The percent of survivors in class 2 is",survivors_2
    17.)output "The percent of survivors in class 3 is",survivors_3,"The percent of survivors over the age of  50 are",survivors_over_50
    18.)close the input file
    19.)close the output file
    20.)except an error
       a. output "This file does not exist"
       b.end the program




Function Name:main
Purpose:main
Parameters:none
Return:none

1.)Output the purpose of the program to the user
2.)Call the read_in_file function
3.)Call the process_file function
