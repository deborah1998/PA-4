This weeks programming assignment was fairly difficult to come up with an effective and correct solution for.
This weeks programming assignment also entailed a lot and allowed me to practice working with files and string modifications
such as splitting strings and concatenation as well as give me more practice with error checking and function design and implementation.
I was struggling a lot while working on my code when it came to working with files and with the new error checking method of  try and except to
prevent runtime errors in my code.Evrey time I would run my code it would output to the python console Process finished with exit code 0
without displaying any of the information I would want my code to print under the main function.This frustrated me as I didnt know
neccesarily what I  was doing wrong in the first place.
