This weeks programming assignment was fairly difficult to come up with an effective and correct solution for.
This weeks programming assignment also entailed a lot and allowed me to practice working with files and string modifications
such as splitting strings and concatenation as well as give me more practice with error checking and function design and implementation.
I was struggling a lot while working on my code when it came to working with files and with the new error checking method of  try and except to
prevent runtime errors in my code.Evrey time I would run my code it would output to the python console Process finished with exit code 0
without displaying any of the information I would want my code to print under the main function.This frustrated me as I didn't know
neccessarilly what I  was doing wrong in the first place.However I was rectified this problem by rearranging my code.In addition I  had intial problems
saving the answers to questions to the outpile file but i tried various ways of writing the solution and referenced my class notes to fix that issue.
I found it really interesting in this lab seeing how everything weve learned in class so far makes for better and more efficient code
and allows us to have neater code as well.I also had a hard time figuring out how to make my testcases as I was unclear at first at how
I should make them but I then figured it out and made sure my test cases matched the outputs of my code.
